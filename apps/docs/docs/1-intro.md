content_guide: 
  purpose: To introduce the concept of modeling in software development, particularly in the context of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and the Open Domain Specification (ODS).
  audience: 
    - Software developers
    - Architects
    - Product managers
    - Anyone interested in improving communication and alignment in software projects
  tone: Friendly, inviting, and relatable
  emotion:
    - Nodding in recognition.
    - A little frustration about past experiences.
    - Realising this isn’t just “bad communication” but a deeper, repeated problem.
  takeaway:
    - Understanding the importance of effective modeling in software development.
    - Recognizing the value of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Open Domain Specification (ODS) in creating shared understanding.

# Introduction

Every team builds **models**.

- 📝 Some are scribbled on whiteboards.
- 📊 Some are drawn as architecture diagrams.
- 🧠 Some live only in the heads of a few key people.

We build models because reality is **too complex** to hold all at once.
A model helps us **simplify, communicate, and navigate**.

But not all models are equal:

- ⚙️ Too close to the **code**.
- 📦 Too tied to today’s **implementation**.
- 🗺️ Too detailed to actually **use as a guide**.

And when models fail, misalignment creeps in:

- 🔀 People use the **same words** to mean different things.
- 💬 Meetings feel clear but lead to **confusion later**.
- 📉 Business and technology **drift apart**.

✨ DDD is about a *different way* to model:

* Focusing on the **language of the domain**.
* Making the **language of the business explicit**.
* Creating maps that **omit noise** and highlight what matters.
* Helping **everyone** — technical or not — speak the same words.

This is the heart of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**,
and the reason the **Open Domain Specification (ODS)** exists.
