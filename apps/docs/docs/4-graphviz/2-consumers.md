# Consumer Map

By using the `ODSConsumableMap` class, you can create a consumer map that defines consumables and consumers and their relationships. The `consumableMapToDigraph` function converts this map into a Graphviz digraph.

This will produce the following SVG diagram:

![consumer-map-example.svg](../../static/img/consumable-map-example.svg)

```ts file=../../tests/consumer.example.test.ts
```
