# eShop Example Workspace

This package demonstrates the Open Domain Specification (ODS) with a sample e-commerce domain, showcasing how to structure domains, subdomains, bounded contexts, services, and aggregates.

It builds the `eShop` workspace using the ODS DSL and generates a static documentation site using `Docsify` for easy navigation and exploration.

See the https://eshop.open-ds.io for a live demo of the site.
