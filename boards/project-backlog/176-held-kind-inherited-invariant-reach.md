# A held value kind puts inherited attributes in invariant reach

Issue #126. Astra's eleventh exact-head review reproduced an Invoice holding Fee, a kind of Money, while the aggregate and context rejected a constraint on inherited Money.amount. Decision 22 says Fee has Money's attributes; decision 27 puts held values in the invariant boundary.

## Checklist

- [x] Holding a specialised value includes its ancestor kinds in aggregate and context invariant reach
- [x] Focused test covers both scopes and an unheld sibling kind before and after JSON round-trip
- [x] Decision 22 states the corrected reach
- [x] Clean-code review and full local gate — Passed unmodified on clean reviewed candidate `e5cda1260f09b5b69a41b0a4027bd63fd33b1899` (exit 0); merged tree `6efd1aa35bae524dfce9345210096caeafcef236` matches the reviewed tree. This is product-candidate evidence, not a gate rerun on this metadata update.
- [x] Exact-head independent signoff — OpenAI Astra low APPROVED exact reviewed candidate `e5cda1260f09b5b69a41b0a4027bd63fd33b1899`; owner-authorized OpenAI-only exception applies; no Claude approval is claimed.

## Gates

- [x] exact-head-landing — `bash scripts/verify-all.sh` passed unmodified on clean reviewed candidate `e5cda1260f09b5b69a41b0a4027bd63fd33b1899` (exit 0): core 1,596, graphviz 50, doc 82, skill 154, Pages 1,056, docs 24, VS Code app 22, host-checker 31; browser 431 passed / 20 documented baseline skips; Pages coverage 100%; exact model pins held. Merged tree `6efd1aa35bae524dfce9345210096caeafcef236` exactly matches the reviewed candidate tree. This is product-candidate evidence, not a gate rerun on this metadata update (lead, 2026-10-02T23:42:13Z).

## Journal

- **lead** (2026-10-01): The holding walk now records each parent of a discovered value kind, while following the value's inherited attributes for composition. A cycle guard keeps invalid specialisation graphs finite. The focused direct and round-trip regression passes; an unheld sibling Rate remains rejected.
- **lead** (2026-10-01): Full validator suite (491), core typecheck and formatter pass. Clean-code pass over the changed walk and test found no scored violation: ownership remains local, the ancestor loop is cycle-safe, and the test covers the one-way boundary.

- **Delivery flow checkpoint** (2026-10-01): Integrated implementation now awaits the model batch's final gate, signoff and landing, so the card is in `review`. This is a workflow-state correction, not an issue closure or claim of final approval.

- **lead** (2026-10-02T23:42:13Z): Reconciled issue #126 (Inherited held value-kind reach) after its individual acceptance comment was published and the issue closed. Reviewed product SHA `e5cda1260f09b5b69a41b0a4027bd63fd33b1899` was APPROVED by OpenAI Astra low; PR #132 merged as `5a6241288973fc3befdb2f46876e28174534126e` and merged tree `6efd1aa35bae524dfce9345210096caeafcef236` equals the reviewed tree. Exact-head local gate passed; actual VS Code hosts passed 16 with four documented optional screenshot skips, keyboard passed 23, checker exit 0 (generic host coverage; no dedicated NorthBank Money assertion). Owner-authorized OpenAI-only exception applies; no Claude approval is claimed.
